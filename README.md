## Getting started

Follow the [instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) to install Teensyduino (which includes installing Arduino):

Open 'InfinityTable.ino' in Arduino, then go to Sketch ... Include Library ... Manage Libraries and install OctoWS2811.  Plug in the USB, click verify, and then click Upload to send your program to the teensy.  This fails about half the time for me randomly (even when there are no compiler errors), but it usually works on the second try.
